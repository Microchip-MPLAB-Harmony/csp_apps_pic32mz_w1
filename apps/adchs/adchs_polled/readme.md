# ADCHS polling

This example application shows how to sample an analog input using the ADCHS peripheral and displays the converted samples on a serial terminal.

## Description

In this application, an analog input is converted by a hardware trigger generated by the TMR peripheral. Converted digital value is displayed on the serial terminal.

## Downloading and building the application

To download or clone this application from Github, go to the [top level of the repository](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/csp_apps_pic32mz_w1) and click

### Setting up PIC32MZ W1 Curiosity Board

- Connect the J209 jumper of a temperature sensor
- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable
- On the GPIO Header (J207), connect U1RX (PIN 13) and U1TX (PIN 23) to TX and RX pin of any USB to UART converter like [USB UART click](https://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click) respectively

## Running the Application

1. Open the Terminal application (Ex.:Tera term) on the computer
2. Connect to the "USB to UART" COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
3. Build and Program the application project using its IDE
4. Console displays the ADC count and the ADC input voltage
