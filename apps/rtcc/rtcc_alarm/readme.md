# RTCC alarm interrupt

This example application shows how to use the RTCC to configure the time and generate the alarm.

## Description

This example application shows how to setup RTCC time and configure alarm using the RTCC Peripheral Library. The application sets up an alarm to be generated every day at a specified time. A message is sent via the Virtual COM port on the alarm trigger.

## Downloading and building the application

| Project Name| Board|
|:---------|:---------:|
| pic32mz_w1_curiosity.X | PIC32MZ W1 Curiosity Board |
|||

### Setting up PIC32MZ W1 Curiosity Board

- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable
- On the GPIO Header (J207), connect U1RX (PIN 13) and U1TX (PIN 23) to TX and RX pin of any USB to UART converter (for eg: [USB UART click board](https://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click))

## Running the Application

1. Open the Terminal application (Ex.:Tera term) on the computer
2. Connect to the "USB to UART" COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
3. Build and Program the application project using its IDE
4. Console output will be as given below in the beginning:
