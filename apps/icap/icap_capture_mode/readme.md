# ICAP capture mode

This example application shows how to use the ICAP peripheral to measure the pulse width of the input signal.

## Description

In this application, a pulse signal is generated using the OCMP peripheral and is fed to the ICAP input. ICAP peripheral captures the time at every edge and displays the pulse width on the serial terminal.

## Downloading and building the application

To clone or download this application from Github, go to the [main page of this repository](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/csp_apps_pic32mz_w1) and then click **Clone** button to clone this repository or download as zip file.

### Setting up PIC32MZ W1 Curiosity Board

- Connect the OC3 pin RA14 (Pin 4 of the XPRO header) to the IC1 pin RA10 (pin 9 of the XPRO header)
- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable
- On the GPIO Header (J207), connect U1RX (PIN 13) and U1TX (PIN 23) to TX and RX pin of any USB to UART converter (for eg: [USB UART click board](https://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click))

## Running the Application

1. Open the Terminal application (Ex.:Tera term) on the computer
2. Connect to the "USB to UART" COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
3. Build and Program the application project using its IDE
4. Console displays the captured pulse width as shown below:
