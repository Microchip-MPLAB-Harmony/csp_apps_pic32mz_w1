# TMR periodic interrupt

This example demonstrates how to use the TMR module in timer mode to generate periodic interrupt.

## Description

The TMR module generates periodic interrupt on 1 second period match. The LED is toggled in the interrupt handler to indicate periodic callback. Two TMR modules are used to form a 32-bit timer.
