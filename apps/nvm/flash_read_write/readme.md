# NVM flash read write

This example application demonstrates how to use the NVM to erase and program the internal Flash memory.

## Description

This example uses the NVM peripheral library to erase a page and write an array of values to the internal Flash memory. It verifies the value written by reading the values back and comparing it to the value written.

## Downloading and building the application

To download or clone this application from Github, go to the [top level of the repository](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/csp_apps_pic32mz_w1) and click
