# DMAC memory transfer

This example application demonstrates how to use the DMAC peripheral to do a memory to memory transfer.

## Description

The application uses a software trigger to initiate a memory-memory transfer from the source buffer to the destination buffer with 16-bit beat size and 32-bit beat size. Transfer status is reported on console.

## Downloading and building the application

To download or clone this application from Github, go to the [top level of the repository](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/csp_apps_pic32mz_w1) and click

| Project Name| Board|
|:---------|:---------:|
| pic32mz_w1_curiosity.X | PIC32MZ W1 Curiosity Board |
|||

### Setting up PIC32MZ W1 Curiosity Board

- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable
- On the GPIO Header (J207), connect U1RX (PIN 13) and U1TX (PIN 23) to TX and RX pin of any USB to UART converter (for eg: [USB UART click board](https://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click))

## Running the Application

1. Open the Terminal application (Ex.:Tera term) on the computer
2. Connect to the "USB to UART" COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
3. Build and Program the application project using its IDE
4. Following message is output on console:

5. The LED indicates the success or failure:
   - The LED is turned ON when the DMAC memory transfer is successful
